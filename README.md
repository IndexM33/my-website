# PAT Testing Data Collection

This repository contains a small React-based web app for recording PAT testing information. The site is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages and works entirely in the browser.

## Features

- Collect engineer name, address, company details and serial number.
- Add multiple tested items with individual results.
- Data is saved to `localStorage` so it persists between sessions.

To run the site locally, simply open `index.html` in your browser or deploy the repository with GitHub Pages.
